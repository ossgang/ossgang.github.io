# We are ...

We are a bunch of open-source enthusiasts and we like to write readable and reusable code. 
Within our core github organization, we work currently on the following projects (currently mainly java focused):

# Our projects within the [ossgang](https://github.com/ossgang) organization

.. there are a few things, which we consider quite 'core' and general for our java work. 
These are the things we maintain within this [github organization](https://github.com/ossgang).


### [ossgang-commons](ossgang-commons)
This is a set of java classes, which we felt we were mission in other libraries. Currently, the main components there are:
* a generic `Maybe` object, which contains either a value or an error (exception).
* a property mechanism, quite similar to the one known from javafx, but not boound to any GUI framework.


### [ossgang-spring-wonderland](ossgang-spring-wonderland)
A simple mechanism to load a certain collection of beans in a spring-based application, 
based on naming conventions. This is particularly useful for situations, where a very flexible 
approach is required, e.g. for testing and commissioning. 

# Other projects

A library for dealing comfortably with multidimensional objects in java.

### [minifx](https://minifx.org/)
A set of minimalistic libraries for structuring JavaFx GUIs within spring.

### [jmad](https://jmad.io/)

mainly developed and used at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
