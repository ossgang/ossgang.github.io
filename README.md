# We are ...

We are a bunch of open-source enthusiasts and we like to write readable and reusable code. 
Within our core github organization, we work currently on the following projects (currently mainly java focused):

# Our projects

## Within the [ossgang](.) organization

### [ossgang-commons](ossgang-commons)
This is a set of java classes, whic we were lacking in other libraries. Currently, the main components there are:
* a generic `Maybe` object, which contains either a value or an error (exception).
* a property mechanism, quite similar to the one known from javafx, but not boound to any GUI framework.


### [ossgang-spring-wonderland](ossgang-spring-wonderland)
A simple mechanism to load a certain collection of beans in a spring-based application, 
based on naming conventions. This is particularly useful for situations, where a very flexible 
approach is required, e.g. for testing and commissioning.
